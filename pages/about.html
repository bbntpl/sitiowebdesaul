				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hi there! I'm Saul Goodman, but you can call me "Better Call Saul!" I'm a lawyer, and I specialize in helping
					my
					clients navigate the murky waters of criminal law.
				</p>
				<p>
					I grew up in Chicago and studied law at the University of American Samoa. Since then, I've been practicing law
					in Albuquerque, New Mexico. My legal career has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, but I've learned a lot
					along the way. I've represented all kinds of clients, from small-time crooks to big-time drug lords, and I've
					seen it all.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you ever find yourself in legal trouble, don't hesitate to give me a call. I'll do everything in my power to help you out – and I'll look damn good doing it!
				</p>

				<p>Don’t let false accusations bully you into an unfair fight! I’m Saul Goodman and I’ll do the fighting for
					you! No charge is too big for me. When legal forces have you cornered, better call Saul!</p>
				<p>I’ll get your case dismissed! I’ll give you the defense you deserve! Why? Because I’m Saul Goodman, attorney
					at law. I investigate, advocate, persuade, and most importantly, win! Better call Saul!</p>
				<p>Do you feel doomed? Have opponents of freedom wrongly intimidated you? Maybe they told you that you’re in
					serious trouble and there’s nothing you can do about it. I’m Saul Goodman, and I’m here to tell you that
					they’re wrong! It’s never too late for justice. Better call saul!</p>
